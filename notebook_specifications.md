# Technical Specification for Jupyter Notebook: Risk Appetite & Allocation Modeler

This specification details the structure, content, and functionality of a Jupyter Notebook designed to explore the fundamental concepts of risk appetite and its allocation within an organization, consistent with the PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook.

---

## 1. Notebook Overview

### Learning Goals
This interactive lab aims to enable users to:
*   Understand the concept of risk appetite and its importance in operational risk management.
*   Learn how `Board Appetite` can be allocated to `Business and Entities` and how `Individual Risk Exposures` aggregate to the `Total firm risk profile`.
*   Explore the interplay between `Supply side` and `Demand side` factors in influencing business choices based on appetite.
*   Visualize how different levels of risk tolerance impact the firm's overall risk landscape.
*   Understand the key insights contained in the provided theoretical background and supporting data.

### Expected Outcomes
Upon completing this notebook, users will be able to:
*   Interactively define a firm's top-level `Board Appetite`.
*   Simulate the cascading allocation of this appetite down to synthetic business units.
*   Input `Individual Risk Exposures` and `Thresholds` for `Risk Tolerance` for each business unit.
*   Visualize the hierarchical breakdown of `Board Appetite` and the aggregation of `Individual Risk Exposures` into the `Total firm risk profile` through a treemap or sunburst chart.
*   Analyze comparisons of each business unit's `Individual Risk Exposure` against its `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance` using color-coded bar charts (Green, Amber, Red status).
*   Gain a practical understanding of how quantitative appetite statements guide `Business choices`, influence `Risk allocation processes`, and contribute to effective `Risk monitoring processes`.

## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will provide the necessary theoretical background, definitions, and formulas, presented clearly with LaTeX.

### 2.1. Core Concepts and Definitions

*   **Risk Appetite**: The amount of risk, on a broad level, an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. As stated in the PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook (Chapter 5, p. 12), "To quantify risk, the obvious question is 'against what measure?' Hence, it is a popular misconception that operational risk should be a zero tolerance risk. This is unrealistic as a yardstick for measuring risk." It is a top-down management tool that quantifies the acceptable level of risk.

*   **Risk Profile**: This represents the aggregation of all individual risk exposures across the firm. The PRMIA Handbook (Chapter 5, p. 14) emphasizes, "Firms manage what they measure, hence the importance of a common understanding of risk profile (the aggregation of all their individual risk exposures) and how it relates to risk appetite."

*   **Board Appetite**: The overall, top-level risk appetite set by the organization's board for operational losses, typically expressed as a maximum acceptable annual loss (e.g., in millions of dollars). This is the starting point for risk allocation within the firm.

*   **Allocated Appetite**: The portion of the `Board Appetite` that is assigned to specific business units or departments. This cascading allocation ensures that the firm's overall risk limits are respected across all entities.

*   **Individual Risk Exposure**: This represents the simulated actual losses or Key Risk Indicator (KRI) levels experienced by a specific business unit. These exposures aggregate upwards to form the `Total Firm Risk Profile`.

*   **Risk Tolerance**: The maximum acceptable deviation from the defined risk appetite. It sets the boundaries within which a business unit's risk exposure is considered acceptable. The PRMIA Handbook (Chapter 5, p. 14) notes, "Many firms adopt red-amber-green (RAG) signals to highlight when a risk is near or above appetite."

*   **Expected Loss (EL)**: Losses that are quantifiable, relatively frequent (e.g., occurring at least once per year), and generally predictable. These are typically absorbed into the business unit's budget. As per the handbook (Chapter 5, p. 16), EL is often defined by its frequency and severity, typically below a management materiality threshold for `Unexpected Loss`.

*   **Unexpected Loss (UL)**: Losses that are less frequent, have higher severity, and are harder to predict. These losses are typically funded by the firm's capital and are a focus for senior management attention (Chapter 5, p. 17).

*   **Supply Side Factors**: Internal organizational capabilities and resources that influence business choices and the risk allocation process. These include elements like `People`, `Culture`, and `Capacity` (Chapter 5, p. 13 diagram).

*   **Demand Side Factors**: External market conditions and opportunities that influence business choices and the risk allocation process. These include `Clients`, `Products`, and the `Marketplace` (Chapter 5, p. 13 diagram).

### 2.2. Key Formulas

The following formulas are central to the model's calculations:

1.  **Allocated Appetite Calculation**:
    The `Allocated Appetite` for a specific business unit $i$ is calculated as a percentage of the overall `Board Appetite`.
    $$ \text{Allocated Appetite}_i = \text{Board Appetite} \times \text{Allocation Percentage}_i $$
    This formula quantitatively distributes the top-level appetite across the organization's entities.

2.  **Total Firm Risk Profile Aggregation**:
    The `Total Firm Risk Profile` is the sum of `Individual Risk Exposures` from all business units.
    $$ \text{Total Firm Risk Profile} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Individual Risk Exposure}_i $$
    Where $n$ is the number of business units. This formula demonstrates the bottom-up aggregation of risk exposures to derive the firm's overall risk position.

3.  **Risk Status (RAG) Determination**:
    The Risk Status (Red, Amber, Green) is derived by comparing the `Individual Risk Exposure` against the `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance` for each business unit. This is a logical comparison based on predefined thresholds:
    *   **Green**: The `Individual Risk Exposure` is less than or equal to the `Allocated Appetite`. This indicates the business unit is operating within its acceptable risk limits.
    *   **Amber**: The `Individual Risk Exposure` is greater than the `Allocated Appetite` but less than or equal to the `Risk Tolerance`. This signals that the unit is exceeding its appetite but is still within its defined tolerance level, requiring monitoring or minor corrective action.
    *   **Red**: The `Individual Risk Exposure` is greater than the `Risk Tolerance`. This indicates that the unit has exceeded its maximum acceptable deviation from the appetite, requiring immediate attention and escalation.

### 2.3. Real-world Application and Interplay

This model demonstrates how quantitative risk appetite statements are crucial for effective operational risk management. By interactively adjusting the `Board Appetite` and observing its cascaded impact, users can grasp how risk appetite guides `Business choices` and influences the `Risk allocation process` and `Risk monitoring process`. The comparison of `Individual Risk Exposure` against `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance` with RAG status provides a practical illustration of the `Risk monitoring process` and informs the `Risk escalation process` within a firm, reinforcing the idea that objective measures are the basis for such triggers (Chapter 5, p. 14). The `Supply side` and `Demand side` factors are conceptually represented by the need for strategic allocation and monitoring against actual performance, aligning internal capacities with external opportunities while respecting risk limits.

*   **Markdown Cell**:
    *   **Title**: `# Risk Appetite & Allocation Modeler`
    *   **Introduction**: Explain the purpose of the notebook and its connection to operational risk management principles outlined in the PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook. Outline the simulation's objective: to demonstrate the top-down allocation of `Board Appetite` and bottom-up aggregation of `Individual Risk Exposures`.
*   **Code Cell**:
    *   **Purpose**: Install and import all necessary open-source Python libraries.
    *   **Content**:
        *   Standard imports: `pandas`, `numpy`.

    *   **Help Text**: Provide inline help text for each control.
*   **Code Cell**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement interactive widgets for user input.
    *   **Content**:
        *   `Board Appetite`: An `ipywidgets.FloatSlider` or `FloatText` to set the firm's overall `Board Appetite` for operational losses (e.g., ranging from 50 to 500 in millions of dollars), with a sensible default.
            *   Help text: "Set the firm's total maximum acceptable annual operational loss in millions of dollars."
        *   `Allocation Percentages`: Multiple `ipywidgets.FloatSlider` or `FloatText` widgets, one for each synthetic business unit (e.g., "Retail Banking Allocation %", "Investment Banking Allocation %", "IT Operations Allocation %"). These will range from 0 to 100, with a default distribution summing to 100%. A validation logic will ensure the sum remains 100% or provide a warning.
            *   Help text: "Allocate the Board Appetite across different business units (percentages must sum to 100%)."
        *   `Individual Risk Exposures`: Multiple `ipywidgets.FloatText` or `FloatSlider` widgets for each business unit to input their simulated `Individual Risk Exposures` (e.g., in millions of dollars). Default values can come from the synthetic dataset.
            *   Help text: "Input the simulated actual operational losses or Key Risk Indicator (KRI) levels for each business unit (in millions of dollars)."
        *   `Risk Tolerance Multipliers` (or direct input): Multiple `ipywidgets.FloatText` or `FloatSlider` widgets for each business unit to set their `Risk Tolerance` thresholds.

*   **Code Cell**:
    *   **Purpose**: Perform calculations and display a summary table.
    *   **Content**:
        *   A function `calculate_allocated_appetite(board_appetite, allocation_percentages)`: Computes the `Allocated Appetite` for each business unit.
        *   A function `aggregate_firm_risk(individual_exposures)`: Sums all `Individual Risk Exposures` to calculate the `Total Firm Risk Profile`.
        *   A function `determine_risk_status(exposure, allocated_appetite, tolerance)`: Implements the RAG logic to assign 'Green', 'Amber', or 'Red' status for each business unit.

*   **Code Cell**:
    *   **Purpose**: Generate and display the required visualizations.
    *   **Content**:
        *   **Hierarchical Visualization**:
            *   Generate a treemap or sunburst chart (preferably using `plotly.express` for interactivity) to illustrate the hierarchical breakdown of the `Board Appetite` down to the `Allocated Appetite` for each synthetic business unit.
            *   The root should represent the `Board Appetite`, with child nodes representing `Allocated Appetite` for "Retail Banking", "Investment Banking", and "IT Operations".
            *   Sizes within the chart will be proportional to the monetary value.
            *   Ensure a clear title, labeled axes (if applicable for treemap/sunburst), and a color-blind-friendly palette. Font size $\ge 12$ pt.

    *   **Implications**: Explain the practical implications for business decision-making, the `Risk monitoring process`, and potential `Risk escalation processes`. Link back to the concepts of `Supply side` and `Demand side` influencing these choices.
    *   **Call to Action**: Encourage users to experiment with different inputs to deepen their understanding.

### 3.2. Expected Libraries

*   **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **Interactive Widgets**: `ipywidgets`
*   **Visualization**: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `plotly.express` (for interactive treemap/sunburst)

### 3.3. Input/Output Expectations

*   **Inputs**:
    *   User-defined numeric values via `ipywidgets` for: `Board Appetite`, `Allocation Percentages` per business unit, `Individual Risk Exposures` per business unit, and `Risk Tolerance` (or multiplier) per business unit.
    *   (Optional): If the user wishes to provide their own data for `Individual Risk Exposure` and `Risk Tolerance` for more business units, the notebook will expect a `CSV` or `Excel` file with specified columns (e.g., `Business Unit`, `ExposureValue`, `ToleranceValue`). A lightweight sample (≤ 5 MB) will be internally provided to ensure the notebook runs even without this user input.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   A `pandas.DataFrame` displayed in a formatted table, summarizing calculated `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Status` for each business unit, alongside user inputs.
    *   The calculated `Total Firm Risk Profile` as a single numeric value.
    *   A hierarchical Treemap or Sunburst chart visualizing the allocation of `Board Appetite`.
    *   Bar charts comparing `Individual Risk Exposure` against `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance` for each business unit, with RAG color-coding.
    *   Clear and concise textual analysis, interpretation, and conclusions presented in markdown cells.

### 3.4. Algorithms and Functions (No Code)

*   `generate_synthetic_data()`: Creates a `pandas.DataFrame` with synthetic `Business Unit` (categorical), `Individual Risk Exposure` (numeric), and `Risk Tolerance` (numeric) values. This function will include internal data validation checks for expected column names, data types, and primary-key uniqueness (`Business Unit`). It will also assert no missing values in critical fields and log summary statistics for numeric columns.
*   `validate_allocations(percentages)`: A utility function to ensure that the sum of `Allocation Percentages` equals 100% (or is within a negligible epsilon for float comparisons) and that all percentages are non-negative.
*   `calculate_allocated_appetite(board_appetite, allocation_percentages)`: Computes the monetary `Allocated Appetite` for each business unit based on the `Board Appetite` and their respective `Allocation Percentages`.
*   `aggregate_firm_risk(individual_exposures)`: Sums the `Individual Risk Exposures` of all business units to yield the `Total Firm Risk Profile`.
*   `determine_risk_status(exposure, allocated_appetite, tolerance)`: A function that applies the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) logic to compare `Individual Risk Exposure` against `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance`, returning the appropriate status string.
*   `plot_hierarchical_appetite(df)`: Generates the treemap or sunburst chart visualizing the `Board Appetite` distribution.
*   `plot_comparison_bars(df)`: Generates the bar chart(s) comparing `Individual Risk Exposure` against `Allocated Appetite` and `Risk Tolerance`, with RAG status color-coding.

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

### 4.1. Assumptions
*   Operational losses are quantifiable in monetary terms, allowing for direct comparison with appetite and tolerance thresholds.
*   The synthetic business units used in the simulation are representative of a typical organizational structure for demonstrating cascading risk appetite.
*   For the purpose of this interactive lab, the simulation focuses on a single time period, providing a snapshot of risk allocation and monitoring. The framework, however, is designed to be conceptually extensible to time-series analysis if historical data were available.

### 4.2. Constraints
*   **Performance**: The lab must execute end-to-end on a mid-spec laptop (8 GB RAM) in fewer than 5 minutes. This necessitates efficient data processing and visualization techniques.
*   **Libraries**: Only open-source Python libraries available on PyPI may be used.
*   **Code Clarity**: All major steps in the notebook will be accompanied by both concise code comments within code cells and brief narrative explanations in markdown cells, describing **what** is happening and **why**.
*   **Output Format**: The notebook will **not** include deployment steps or platform-specific references (e.g., Streamlit, Dash). The specification itself does **not** contain direct Python code implementations.
*   **Visual Style**: All visualizations will adopt a color-blind-friendly palette. The font size for titles, labels, and legends will be $\ge 12$ pt to ensure readability. Clear titles, labeled axes, and legends will be supplied for all plots. Interactivity will be enabled where the Jupyter environment supports it (e.g., `plotly.express`), and a static fallback (saved PNG) will be provided for environments where interactivity is not available.

### 4.3. Customization Instructions
*   **Parameter Adjustment**: Users can easily modify the `Board Appetite`, `Allocation Percentages`, `Individual Risk Exposures`, and `Risk Tolerance` values through the interactive widgets provided early in the notebook. After adjusting, simply re-run the subsequent cells to update all calculations and visualizations in real-time.
*   **Extending Business Units**: The notebook design will allow for a clear pathway to add or modify the list of synthetic business units by updating a central list/dictionary, which would then dynamically generate the corresponding input widgets and data structures for calculations and plots.
*   **Interpreting RAG Status**: Inline help text and markdown explanations will guide users on how to interpret the Green, Amber, and Red statuses. Green implies satisfactory performance, Amber indicates a need for increased monitoring or minor corrective actions, and Red signifies that risk exposure has breached tolerance and requires immediate escalation and remediation efforts.
