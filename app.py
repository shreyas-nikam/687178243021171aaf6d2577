In this lab, we explore the core concepts of **Risk Appetite & Allocation** within an organizational context.
This interactive application allows you to:
- Define a firm's top-level `Board Appetite`.
- Simulate the cascading allocation of this appetite to various business units.
- Visualize individual business unit risk exposures against their allocated limits.
- Understand how individual risk exposures aggregate to form the `Total Firm Risk Profile`.
- Compare the `Total Firm Risk Profile` with the `Board Appetite` to assess overall firm health.


### Glossary of Terms:
    
- **Risk Appetite:** The amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to take in order to meet its strategic objectives.
- **Risk Tolerance:** The acceptable level of variation around the risk appetite.
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** Metrics used to provide an early signal of increasing risk exposures.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Actions taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.
    
### Key Concepts:
- **Board Appetite:** The maximum level of risk a firm is willing to accept to achieve its strategic objectives.
- **Allocated Appetite:** The portion of the Board Appetite assigned to specific business units or functions.
- **Individual Risk Exposure:** The actual or estimated risk a specific business unit is facing (e.g., operational losses).
- **Risk Tolerance:** The acceptable deviation from the allocated appetite before triggering management action. It is expressed as a factor that, when multiplied by Allocated Appetite, gives Absolute Risk Tolerance.
- **Risk Status (RAG):**
    - `Green`: Exposure $\le$ Allocated Appetite
    - `Amber`: Allocated Appetite $<$ Exposure $\le$ Absolute Risk Tolerance
    - `Red`: Exposure $>$ Absolute Risk Tolerance

This model helps in understanding the hierarchical breakdown of risk appetite and the aggregation of risk exposures, providing a visual comparison of risk against limits using a Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status system.
